# bourbon_journal_frontend

This program was created to help people track to help manage food pantry and non-profit donations.

This web application allows a user to create a model representing a visit or delivery to a food pantry, and record a list of items to donate to that particular organization on that visit. 

Users can add multiple items per visit, and add the same organization they visit multiple times, allowing for the logging of different dates.

## Usage

Please have ruby, rails, and node.js installed prior to running this application.

From within that directory, run 'rails s' in your terminal, then open 'localhost:3000' (or the listening port stated in your terminal) in a web browser.

Finally, open the index.html file in a web browser.

The close the program, exit your web browser and type 'contrl/command + C' in your terminal to exit rails console.
